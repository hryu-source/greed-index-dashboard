# Greed Index Dashboard

This simple dashboard displays the current Fear & Greed Index and lists the top 10 companies with the largest market capitalizations and low price-to-earnings ratios.

Due to restrictions on the original public API used for the company table, the list of companies is now served from a static `companies.json` file included in this project. This avoids issues fetching data when the page is published on the web. You can replace this file with your own data if real-time results are required.

## Usage
Open `index.html` in a web browser. The page fetches real-time data from public APIs.
